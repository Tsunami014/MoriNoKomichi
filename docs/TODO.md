# TODOs
- [ ] Many wonderful graphs, including;
  - [ ] Sankey diagram of productivity (interactive for more fine-tuned productivity checking)
  - [ ] Pie chart of time spent and applications spent on (like ![this](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/9c5b83edbc3651c9c74e2bf038b872d1b9a4a29cc76fe0e1ceb84731f2958b01/68747470733a2f2f692e706f7374696d672e63632f434b4835685439562f7669732e706e67))
  - [ ] Word chart of applications used
  - [ ] Github-like practice time heatmap graph
  - [ ] Score (daily, weekly, monthly; additionally, the percentage + or -) (score against what you said you would do)
- [ ] Lock-in (specify time and place and amount of time for study, and it won't let you change it)
- [ ] Pomodoro timer (with a 'just let me continue' option)
- [ ] System monitoring (optional) for productivity; keep track of which apps/websites/etc. you use and list them as productive or not
- [ ] Kanban boards to help organise your tasks
- [ ] Priority system
- [ ] Streaks (w/ best streaks view (Habits))
- [ ] Gamification w/ point buy
- [ ] Calendar
- [ ] Sub-tasks
- [ ] Archive
- [ ] Something like a forest to grow, cultivate and keep looking really nice that you can be proud of
- [ ] Really pretty UI and such
