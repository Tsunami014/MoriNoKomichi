# MoriNoKomichi
A todo app which is just the best thing ever

## COMPILING AND RUNNING
Ensure `cmake` is installed. Then, run the following:
```bash
mkdir ./build
cd ./build
cmake ../
make
```
And then in the `./build` folder, you should see an executable you can run to run the program! Additionally, a .exe file is provided in the Releases.
